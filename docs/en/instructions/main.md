# The interface

MySpeed's interface is designed from the ground up to be easy to use. However, to avoid possible confusion, everything
is explained here.

## The user interface

![MySpeed interface](/assets/images/en/interface.png)

The interface of MySpeed is divided into **3** parts.

The **first** part is the so-called header and contains direct access to the settings and the start of a speed test. The
settings are described in more detail [here](settings).

The **second** part always shows the most recent speedtest.

The **third** part shows all created speedtests.

## Last test

![Last test](/assets/images/en/latest.png)

This part always shows the most recent, i.e. last created speedtest. If you click on an icon, the respective help menu
will open with more information.

## Overview of all tests

Here you can view all tests that have been created. Now you can also click on the clock on the left to open a dialog
with more information. This dialog now shows more information about the test and even offers the possibility to delete
it directly (if necessary).
