# Troubleshooting

In this guide, you will learn how to fix known errors with this service.

::: danger Could not open the database file. Maybe it is damaged?
There can be several solutions to this error. Just work through all possibilities and your problem should be solved. :)

1. **Set the required permissions**  
   To set the permissions, enter the command `chmod 700 /opt/myspeed`. (Replace /opt/myspeed with your installation location).

2. **Install the build essentials**  
   It is currently possible that the error occurs because the `build-essential` package is not installed. Simply reinstall it with the command `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.

3. **Perform a new installation of the modules**  
   First, enter the command `rm -R node_modules` in the installation folder to delete the modules and then reinstall them with `npm install`.

::: danger This MySpeed instance is currently in development mode
This is not really an error, just a backup to use the tool only in production environments.
Set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to the value `production`.  
On Linux, you can do this with `export NODE_ENV=production` and on Windows in the PowerShell with `$env:NODE_ENV="production"`.  
Also, read the [guide for 24/7 installation](setup/linux) if you plan to run MySpeed in the background and start it automatically at system startup.
